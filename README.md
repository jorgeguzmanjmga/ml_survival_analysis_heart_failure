Cardiovascular disease are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Luckily, most cardiovascular disease can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors to population-wide strategies. This project is aiming to do an exploratory data analysis, utilize various machine learning models to detect the most crucial features to predict the heart failure event and apply Cox model, Survival Analysis, and Hazard Ratio to validate the result.  Summary:  Exploratory Data Analysis  Machine Learning Model (GBM, RF, Linear Regression) to select 3 most important features  Cox Model + Proportional Hazard Assumption  Survival Analysis
